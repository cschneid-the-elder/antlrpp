Attempt at a preprocessor for ANTLR4 grammars.

A challenge for grammar authors is writing non-target language specific code.

Since actions are sometimes necessary, this preprocessor seeks to allow one
to write a grammar that "copies" or "includes" or "imports" text into the
grammar at a specified point.

Code is at a proof of concept stage.
